PersistentCRJ
=============
This little app should be used together with the Aerosoft [CRJ-500/700](https://www.aerosoft.com/en/microsoft-flight-simulator/msfs-aircraft/3303/aerosoft-aircraft-crj-550/700).

It saves the state of many of the buttons, switches and knobs in the cockpit. Next time you load a flight you can load the saved state and have the cockpit as you left it.

It's available at [flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to/file/11268/persistentcrj).

I have no intensions to continue the development of this, but feel free to do whatever you want with the code.

Best regards,
Anders
